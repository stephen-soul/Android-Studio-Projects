# Android Studio Movie Trailer App.

This was originally a school project to demonstrate the use of Strings.xml, the use of an SQLite database, and the use of persistance. But I ended up liking it more than not and want to share it... So, enjoy!

This is an Android application that gets a YouTube video and stores the name, description, rating and url into an SQLite database (something stored in the app.) As long as the url is copied from the YouTube app (load the YouTube app, find a video you like, tap share, tap 'copy url') then it will display properly in the YouTube player from the YouTube API. If you have any suggestions on upgrades feel free to edit this code however you would like or send me an email at sfetinko@gmail.com - I'm always looking for ways to improve!
